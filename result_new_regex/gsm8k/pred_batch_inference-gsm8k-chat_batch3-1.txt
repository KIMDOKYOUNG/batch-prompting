A[1]: James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, 3 times a week. So, he runs a total of 3 * 60 * 3 = 540 meters a week.
A[2]: In total, Wendi gives her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. If she has 20 chickens, each chicken gets 40 / 20 = 2 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. Therefore, in the final meal of the day, she needs to give each chicken 3 - 2 = 1 cup of feed.
A[3]: For the first glass, Kylar pays $5. For the second glass, he pays 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. So, for every two glasses, he pays $5 + $3 = $8. Since he wants to buy 16 glasses, he will pay 16 / 2 * $8 = $64.
<d>
A[1]: Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep. Together, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.
A[2]: Carla downloads 40% of the file before the restart, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 200 - 80 = 120 GB. At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it will take her 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download the remaining file. However, she already spent 20 minutes downloading, so in total, it takes her 60 + 20 = 80 minutes to download the file.
A[3]: In the first 3 hours, John drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home. When he turns around, he is 180 miles away. He spends 2 hours in traffic and then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles. This means he has 180 - 15 = 165 miles left to go. At 80 mph, he can cover 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles in the remaining 1.5 hours. So, he is 165 - 120 = 45 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours.

A[1]: Claire eats 3 eggs every morning, so in a week she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 * 4 = 84 eggs. To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12: 84 / 12 = 7 dozens. The answer is 7 dozens.
A[2]: Marissa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. To maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour. The answer is 4 miles per hour.
A[3]: The 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 water, so it contains 10 * 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water. The 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so it contains 15 * 3/5 = 9 liters of water. After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, there are 10 - 1 = 9 liters remaining. When combined with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, there are 9 + 15 = 24 liters total. The total water content in the remaining 24 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. The answer is 15.67 liters.

A[1]: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days she will consume 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she will need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons. Each carton costs $4.00, so in total she will spend 4 * 4 = $16.00 on ice cream.
A[2]: Henry first stopped after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles between his first and second stops.
A[3]: Let x be the cost of the boots. The two pairs of high heels cost $33 and $2 * $33 = $66. Together they cost $33 + $66 = $99, which is $5 less than the boots, so the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.
<d>
A[1]: The total ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7 + 11 = 18. If their total age now is 162, then each part of the ratio represents 162 / 18 = 9. Allen's age is 11 parts, so his age is 11 * 9 = 99 now. In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.
A[2]: The average guess can be calculated by adding up the guesses and dividing by the number of guesses. The guesses are 80, 20 more than half of 80 (which is 20 + 40 = 60), and 25% more than 80 (which is 80 + 0.25*80 = 100). The sum of the guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Since there are 3 guesses, the average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.
A[3]: John spends 10 dogs * 0.5 hours = 5 hours a day taking care of the dogs. In a week, he spends 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours taking care of the dogs.

A[1]: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since they are on sale at 4 for $5.00, he spends 5/4 = $1.25 per yogurt. Therefore, he spends 60 * 1.25 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
A[2]: John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * 15 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since he has $5 left, he must have spent $35 - $5 = $30 on lego sets. Therefore, he still has $30 / 15 = 2 lego sets left.
A[3]: John runs 60 miles in 3 days, so he runs 60 / 3 = 20 miles per day. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs 3 + 3/2 + 3/2 = 6 hours in total. Therefore, he runs at a speed of 20 miles / 6 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.
<d>
A[1]: If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. She can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour. In 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 * 2 = 4 hours walking. So, she can travel 2 * 6 + 4 * 1.5 = 15 miles in 6 hours. The answer is 15 miles.
A[2]: If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, then Ben's iPhone is 1 * 2 = 2 years old and Brandon's iPhone is 2 * 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.
A[3]: When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 3 * 400 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. The answer is 200 feet.

A[2]: The total calories in the bag of chips is 250 * 5 = 1250 calories. If you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000, then you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left. To find out how many grams you can eat, you need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings. Since there are 5 servings in the bag, you can eat 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.
A[3]: Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, so with 1 pound he can make 10 candles. If he sells each candle for $2.00, then he makes 10 * 2 = $20.00 from 1 pound of beeswax. Since the supplies cost $10.00, his net profit per pound is $20.00 - $10.00 = $10.00. If he makes and sells 20 candles, he will need 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. Therefore, his net profit from selling 20 candles is 20 * $10.00 = $200.00.

A[1]: On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took 5 * 4 = 20 hours. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than Monday, so a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles. This took 7 * 4 = 28 hours. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles. This took 14 * 4 = 56 hours. In total, she spent 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours writing articles in the three days.
A[2]: Candice started with 80 post-it notes and placed one on each of 220 cups of coffee, leaving 23 post-it notes remaining. So, she used 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes. Since she purchased a package of post-it notes, the package must have contained 277 - 80 = 197 post-it notes.
A[3]: John bought blue ties at $40 each, spending $200 in total. So, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so they cost $40 + 0.5 * 40 = $60 each. Therefore, he spent 10 * 60 + 5 * 40 = $600 on ties.

A[1]: The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The maximum weight the bridge can carry is 5000 pounds. So, the weight of the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes.
A[2]: The 25% fee on $40.00 is 0.25 * 40 = $10.00. Adding the delivery fees and tip, the total extra fees amount to $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $17.00. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.
A[3]: The total number of raspberries on the bush is calculated by adding the number of fruit in the clusters and the individual fruit. There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, which is 6 * 20 = 120 fruit. Adding the 67 individual fruit, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries.

A[3]: After 30 years, Marcy is entitled to 5% of the pension value per year. So, after 30 years, she will receive 30 * 0.05 * $50,000 = $75,000 per year. The answer is $75,000.
<d>
A[1]: For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 * 6 = $840. For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less, which means she paid $140 - ($140 * 0.10) = $126 per month. So for the second half of the year, she paid $126 * 6 = $756. Therefore, the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.
A[2]: Sophia used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. Therefore, she uses 4 gallons / 100 miles = 1 gallon / 25 miles. Since her tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon = 300 miles on a single tank of gas.
A[3]: Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour. So, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading each day. In a week, he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours. In 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours on TV and reading.

A[1]: After 5 years in the company, Sylvie's salary is increased by 10% each year. After 3 more years, her salary will be increased by 10% for 3 years, which is 10% * 3 = 30%. So her annual salary after 3 more years will be 600 + (600 * 0.30) = 600 + 180 = $780. The answer is $780.
A[2]: Let x be the number of copies Harald sold. Marilyn sold 10x copies. The total number of copies sold is x + 10x = 88,000. This simplifies to 11x = 88,000. Solving for x, we get x = 88,000 / 11 = 8,000. Harald sold 8,000 copies. The answer is 8,000.
A[3]: Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them won't show up, so 16 * 1/4 = 4 friends won't show up. The number of guests that will receive gift bags is 16 - 4 = 12 guests. She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so she needs 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 9 * 2 = $18. The answer is $18.

A[1]: The total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs. The total amount needed for children is 5 children * 10 lbs/2 = 25 lbs. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs of potato salad to feed everyone at the picnic.
A[2]: Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets, and Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets they have is 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.
A[3]: Since James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

A[1]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. With a 10% improvement, Gerald can now run it in 40 * 0.10 = 4 seconds faster. So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.
A[2]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, then the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. The total number of rabbits, dogs, and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 12 (rabbits) = 192 pets.
A[3]: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, which means there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, so the number of girls in the girl scouts is 120 * 2/3 = 80. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scouts is 120 - 80 = 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3 hours.
A[2]: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce. So, the tomatoes lose half their volume, meaning 16 ounces of tomatoes make 32 / 2 = 16 ounces of sauce. Since each can contains three tomatoes, Freda used 16 / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes. However, she can't use a fraction of a tomato, so she used 5 tomatoes. The answer is 5 tomatoes.
A[3]: Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars remained. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes. This means 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5 cars.
