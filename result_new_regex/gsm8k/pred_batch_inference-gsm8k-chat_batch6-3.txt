A[5]: Wendi gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, totaling 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Since she gives them feed in three separate meals, she needs to give them 40 / 3 = 13.33 cups in the final meal. However, since she can't give a fraction of a cup, she will need to give them 14 cups in the final meal.
A[6]: Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of that, which is $5 * 0.6 = $3. So, for 16 glasses, he will pay for 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each, totaling 8 * $5 + 8 * $3 = $40 + $24 = $64. Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses.

A[1]: Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. If there were 14 pieces remaining, then 40 - 14 = 26 pieces were taken by the guests.
A[2]: A 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, with each serving being 250 calories. So the total calories in the bag is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. If you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left. To find out how many grams you can eat, you need to calculate 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings. Since 1 serving is 300g, you can eat 0.8 x 300 = 240g.
A[3]: Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax. If he makes and sells 20 candles, he needs 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax is $10 x 2 = $20. If he sells each candle for $2, his total revenue is 20 x 2 = $40. Therefore, his net profit is $40 - $20 = $20.
A[4]: On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, and on Tuesday, she wrote 5 x 2/5 = 2 articles more than Monday, which is 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she wrote 7 x 2 = 14 articles.

A[1]: For the adults, Ted needs 20 * 10 = 200 lbs of potato salad. For the children, each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. So for the children, Ted needs 5 * 5 = 25 lbs of potato salad. In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad to feed everyone at the picnic.
A[2]: Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. In total, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.
A[3]: Since James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 11 - 5 = 6 years old.
A[4]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 * 0.9 = 34.2 seconds.
A[5]: If there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, then there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so there are 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 rabbits. In total, there are 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.
A[6]: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, so there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. This means there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, so there are 120 * 2/3 = 80 girls in the girl scouts. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scouts is 120 - 80 = 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3.
A[2]: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce. This means that the tomatoes lose half their volume, so 16 ounces of tomatoes make 32 / 2 = 16 ounces of sauce. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 3 tomatoes. The answer is 3.
A[3]: Originally there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through and then 20 more cars drove through. This means 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5.
A[4]: Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, which is a total of 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. She received 18 new potted plants, so she will give away 40 potted plants and remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants. The answer is 40.
