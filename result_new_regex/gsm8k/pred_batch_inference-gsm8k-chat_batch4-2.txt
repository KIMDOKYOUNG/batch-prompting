A[1]: Let x be the number of copies Harald sold. Marilyn sold 10x copies. Together, they sold x + 10x = 11x copies. Given that 11x = 88000, we find x = 8000. Therefore, Harald sold 8000 copies.
A[2]: Christina invited 16 friends, but only 3/4 of them will show up, so 16 * 3/4 = 12 guests will attend. She needs 0.75 * 12 = 9 gift bags. The total cost will be 9 * $2 = $18.
A[3]: The total amount of potato salad needed is calculated by adding the amount needed for adults and children. For adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs = 200 lbs. For children: 5 children * 5 lbs = 25 lbs. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad.
A[4]: Cindy has 4 pets, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets, and Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. Together, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.

A[1]: If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, then Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.
A[2]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. With the 10% improvement, Gerald can now run it in 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.
A[3]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, then the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which is 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. Therefore, there are 168 pets in total in the neighborhood.
A[4]: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, which means there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, which means 120 * 2/3 = 80 girls are in the girl scouts. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scouts is 120 - 80 = 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3 hours.
A[2]: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce. So, the tomatoes lose half their volume. This means that 16 ounces of tomatoes make 32 / 2 = 16 ounces of sauce. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 16 / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes. Since she can't use a fraction of a tomato, she used 5 tomatoes. The answer is 5 tomatoes.
A[3]: Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This means that 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5 cars.
A[4]: Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, so she has 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. If she received 18 new potted plants and decides to give away 1 plant from each ledge, she will remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants. The answer is 40 potted plants.
