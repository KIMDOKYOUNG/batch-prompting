A[2]: In total, Wendi gives her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. If she has 20 chickens, each chicken gets 40 / 20 = 2 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. So, in the final meal of the day, she needs to give each chicken 3 - 2 = 1 cup of feed.
A[3]: Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. For the first glass, he pays $5, and for the second glass, he pays 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. So, for every two glasses, he pays $5 + $3 = $8. Therefore, for 16 glasses, he needs to pay 8 * 8 = $64.
<d>
A[1]: Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep. Together, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.
A[2]: Carla downloads 40% of the file before the restart, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 200 - 80 = 120 GB. At 2 GB/minute, it will take her 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download the remaining file. Adding the 20 minutes for the restart, it will take her 60 + 20 = 80 minutes to download the file.
A[3]: In the first 3 hours, John drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home. In the next 2 hours, he doesn't move, so he is still 180 miles away. In the next half-hour, he drives 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. In the last half-hour, he drives 80 * 0.5 = 40 miles. So, at the end of the 4 hours, he is 180 - 15 - 40 = 125 miles away from home.
<d>
A[1]: For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour. So for 40 hours, she earns 40 * 10 = $400. For the 5 hours of overtime, she earns 10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So for the overtime, she earns 5 * 12 = $60. In total, her earnings for the week are 400 + 60 = $460.
A[2]: In the second month, there were 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. Then in the third month, there were 180 - (180 * 0.30) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads. So the total downloads over the three months are 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.
A[3]: The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * 68 = $204. The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * 80 = $160. The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * 55 = $330. So the total cost is 204 + 160 + 330 = $694.

A[1]: Each year, Carlos earns 7 * 1.5 = $10.5 from selling lemons.
Each year, he spends $3 on watering and feeding the tree.
So, he earns $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.
To start earning money, he needs to cover the initial cost of $90.
Therefore, it will take $90 / $7.5 = 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.
The answer is 12 years.

A[1]: For the jewelry, the market value after a 2.5% increase would be 5000 + (0.025 * 5000) = $5125. For the electronic gadgets, the market value after a 1.2% increase would be 8000 + (0.012 * 8000) = $8096. The profit from the jewelry would be 5125 - 5000 = $125 and the profit from the electronic gadgets would be 8096 - 8000 = $96. Therefore, the merchant would make a profit of $125 if he chooses the jewelry.
A[2]: Each train traveled 80 miles westward and 150 miles northward. So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days would be 80 + 150 = 230 miles.
A[3]: Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. In a week, she works 35 hours as a teacher and 15 hours as a coach, totaling 50 hours per week. So, her weekly salary would be (35 * 20) + (15 * 30) = $700 + $450 = $1150. Her annual salary would be $1150 * 50 weeks = $57,500.

A[1]: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since they are on sale at 4 for $5.00, he spends 5/4 = $1.25 per yogurt. Therefore, he spends 60 * 1.25 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
A[2]: John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * 15 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since he has $5 left, he must have spent $35 - $5 = $30 on lego sets. Therefore, he still has $30 / 15 = 2 lego sets left.
A[3]: John runs 60 miles in 3 days, so he runs 60 / 3 = 20 miles per day. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs 3 + 3/2 + 3/2 = 6 hours in total. Therefore, he runs at a speed of 20 miles / 6 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.
<d>
A[1]: If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour and walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour. In 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 * 2 = 4 hours walking. So, she can travel 2 * 6 + 4 * 1.5 = 15 miles in 6 hours. The answer is 15 miles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.
A[2]: Candice started with 80 post-it notes and placed one on each of the 220 cups of coffee, leaving 23 post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the package she purchased contained 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes.
A[3]: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought 2 * 200 / 40 = 10 blue ties. Since he spent $200 on blue ties, he spent 10 * 40 = $400 on blue ties. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, they cost $40 + 0.5*40 = $60 each. If he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 10 = 20 red ties. Therefore, he spent 20 * 60 = $1200 on red ties. In total, he spent $400 + $1200 = $1600 on ties.

A[1]: After 5 years in the company, Sylvie's salary is increased by 10% each year. So, after 5 years, her salary is $600 + ($600 * 0.10 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900. After 3 more years of service, her salary will be $900 + ($900 * 0.10 * 3) = $900 + $270 = $1170. Therefore, her annual salary after three more years of service will be $1170.
A[2]: Let the number of copies Harald sold be x. Marilyn sold 10x copies. The total number of copies sold is x + 10x = 11x, which is equal to 88,000. Therefore, 11x = 88,000. Solving for x, x = 88,000 / 11 = 8000. Harald sold 8000 copies.
A[3]: Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them won't show up, so 16 * 1/4 = 4 friends won't show up. The number of guests that will receive gift bags is 16 - 4 = 12. She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so she needs 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 9 * $2 = $18 on gift bags.

A[1]: The total amount of potato salad needed can be calculated as follows:
- Adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs
- Children: 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs
Total: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs
Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.
A[2]: 
- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
- Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.
Total pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets
The three of them have a total of 28 pets.
A[3]: Let's determine the ages based on the given information:
- James is 10 years old.
- Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

A[1]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be able to run it two seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. With Gerald's improved speed of 10%, he can now run it in 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds. The answer is 36 seconds.
A[2]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, then there are 2 * 60 = 120 cats. The total number of rabbits is 120 + 60 + 12 = 192. The answer is 192.
A[3]: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, so there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. This means there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so there are 120 * 2/3 = 80 girls in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40. The answer is 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3 hours.
A[2]: Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce. So, the original volume of the tomatoes was 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 16 / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes. However, she can't use a fraction of a tomato, so she used 5 tomatoes. The answer is 5 tomatoes.
A[3]: Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This means that 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5 cars.
