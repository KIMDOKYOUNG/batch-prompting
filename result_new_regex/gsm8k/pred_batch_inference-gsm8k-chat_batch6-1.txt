A[5]: If there are 2 cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, then there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats. The total number of rabbits is 120 - 12 = 108. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 108 (rabbits) = 288 pets.
A[6]: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, which means there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, so the number of girls in the girl scouts is 120 * 2/3 = 80. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scouts is 120 - 80 = 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3 hours.
A[2]: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce. This means that the sauce is half the volume of the canned tomatoes. So, Freda used 16 * 2 = 32 ounces of canned tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 32 / 16 * 3 = 6 tomatoes. The answer is 6 tomatoes.
A[3]: Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This means that 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5 cars.
A[4]: Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, which is a total of 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. She received 18 new potted plants, so she will give away 40 potted plants and remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants. The answer is 40 potted plants.
