A[1]: Each year, Carlos earns $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 from selling lemons. The cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. So, he earns $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year. To start earning money, he needs to cover the initial cost of $90. Therefore, it will take $90 / $7.5 = 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.
A[2]: Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. She sold 1/3 + 2 + 1/2(1/3 + 2) = 5 vacuum cleaners. This simplifies to 1/3 + 2 + 1/6 + 1 = 5. Combining like terms, we get 7/6 + 1 = 5. This simplifies to 7/6 = 4. So, x = 4 * 6 = 24. Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.
A[3]: 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students. So, 20 - 4 = 16 students remained. 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 x 16 = 4 students. Therefore, the remaining students, which is 16 - 4 = 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12 / 20 x 100% = 60%.
A[4]: If the jewelry market goes up by 2.5%, the value of the jewelry will be $5,000 + 0.025 x $5,000 = $5,125. If the electronic gadgets market goes up by 1.2%, the value of the gadgets will be $8,000 + 0.012 x $8,000 = $8,096. The profit from the jewelry would be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets would be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96. Therefore, the merchant would make a profit of $125 by choosing the jewelry.

A[2]: John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * $15 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, spending 8 * $20 = $160. He has $5 left, so he spent $195 - $160 - $5 = $30 on lego sets. Since each lego set costs $15, he still has $30 / $15 = 2 lego sets.
A[3]: John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days, so he runs 60 / 3 = 20 miles a day. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs at a speed of 20 miles / 3 hours = 6.67 miles per hour.
A[4]: Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. So she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking, so in 6 hours, she runs for 6 / 3 = 2 hours and walks for 6 / 3 * 2 = 4 hours. In 2 hours, she travels 2 * 6 = 12 miles, and in 4 hours, she travels 4 * 3 = 12 miles. So in total, she can travel 12 + 12 = 24 miles in 6 hours.
A[5]: Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is 2 times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 * 2 = 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
A[6]: If Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone, then when holding the gemstone, she can throw it 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

A[2]: A 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, so each serving is 300g / 5 = 60g. If each serving has 250 calories, then 60g has 250 calories. If you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left. You can eat 200 / 250 * 60 = 48g of chips.
A[3]: Charlie makes 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax. If he makes and sells 20 candles, he needs 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. The supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax cost $10.00, and he sells each candle for $2.00. So his total revenue is 20 * 2 = $40.00. His net profit is $40 - $10 = $30.00.
A[4]: Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday. The total number of articles she wrote in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours to write, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing articles in the three days.
A[5]: Candice started with 80 post-it notes and placed 220 post-it notes on cups of coffee, leaving 23 post-it notes remaining. This means she used 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes in total. Since she purchased a package of post-it notes, the number of post-it notes in the package is 277 - 80 = 197 post-it notes.
A[6]: John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so they cost $40 * 1.5 = $60 each. Therefore, he spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties. In total, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.

A[1]: Out of 25 oranges, 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. So the total of bad, unripe, and sour oranges is 1 + 0.20*25 + 2 = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8. Therefore, the number of good oranges is 25 - 8 = 17. The answer is 17.
A[2]: Janet paid $500 for materials and $800 for the jeweler, totaling $500 + $800 = $1300. She then paid 10% of $1300 for insurance, which is 0.10 * $1300 = $130. So, in total, she paid $1300 + $130 = $1430. The answer is $1430.
A[3]: After 20 years, Marcy is entitled to 5% of the pension value per year. So, after 30 years, she will receive 30 - 20 = 10 years of 5% of the pension value. This is 10 * 0.05 * $50,000 = $25,000. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000. The answer is $75,000.
A[4]: For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 * 6 = $840. For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less, which is $140 - 0.10 * $140 = $140 - $14 = $126 per month. So, for the second half of the year, she paid $126 * 6 = $756. Therefore, the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596. The answer is $1596.
A[5]: Sophia used 4 gallons to fill up her tank, which means she has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left. Since she traveled 100 miles on 4 gallons, she can travel 100 / 4 = 25 miles per gallon. Therefore, she can drive 25 * 8 = 200 miles on a full tank of gas. The answer is 200 miles.

A[1]: The total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 adults * 10 lbs = 200 lbs. The total amount needed for the children is 5 children * 10 lbs / 2 = 25 lbs. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.
A[2]: Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets, and Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets. The total number of pets they have is 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.
A[3]: Since James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.
A[4]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then Gerald can run the hurdles in 38 * 0.9 = 34.2 seconds.
A[5]: Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats. The total number of rabbits is 120 - 12 = 108. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 108 (rabbits) = 288 pets.
A[6]: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, which means there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, so the number of girls in the girl scouts is 120 * 2/3 = 80. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scouts is 120 - 80 = 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3.
A[2]: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce. This means that the tomatoes lose half their volume, so Freda used 16 * 2 = 32 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 32 / 16 * 3 = 6 tomatoes. The answer is 6.
A[3]: Originally there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars remained. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5.
A[4]: Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, which is a total of 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. She received 18 new potted plants, so she will give away 40 potted plants. Therefore, Mary will remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants. The answer is 40.
