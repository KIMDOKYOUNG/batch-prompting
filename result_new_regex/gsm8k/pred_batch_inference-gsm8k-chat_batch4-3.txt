A[1]: If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, then Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.
A[2]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. With a 10% improvement, Gerald can now run it in 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.
A[3]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, then the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which is 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. Therefore, there are 168 pets in total in the neighborhood.
A[4]: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, which means there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, which means 2/3 * 120 = 80 girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3.
A[2]: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce. This means that half of the volume is lost, so 16 ounces of tomatoes are used. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 16 / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes. Since you can't have a fraction of a tomato, she used 5 tomatoes.
A[3]: Originally there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This means that 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5.
A[4]: Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, which is a total of 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. If she received 18 new potted plants and decides to give away 40 potted plants, she will remain with 80 + 18 - 40 = 58 potted plants. The answer is 58.
