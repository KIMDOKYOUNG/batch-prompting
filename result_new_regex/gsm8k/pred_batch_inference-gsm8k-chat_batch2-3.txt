A[1]: If there are 60 dogs, and 2 cats for every dog, then there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which is 60 + 120 = 180. So, there are 180 - 12 = 168 pets in total. The answer is 168.
A[2]: If 2/5 of the 200 Grade 5 students are boys, then there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. The rest are girls, which is 200 - 80 = 120 girls. If 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, then 1/3 are not. So, 120 * 1/3 = 40 girls are not in the girl scout. The answer is 40.

A[1]: Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of that, which is 9 * 2/3 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3.
A[2]: Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes makes 32 ounces of sauce, so half the volume is lost. This means Freda used 32 / 2 = 16 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 16 ounces, she used 16 / 16 = 1 can of tomatoes. Since each can has 3 tomatoes, Freda used 1 * 3 = 3 tomatoes. The answer is 3.

A[1]: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars drove through the traffic jam. 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, so 25 - 20 = 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5.
A[2]: Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, so she has 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. If she gives away 1 plant from each ledge, she will remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants. The answer is 40.
