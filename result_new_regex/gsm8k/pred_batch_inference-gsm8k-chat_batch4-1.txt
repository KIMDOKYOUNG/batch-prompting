A[1]: Each year, Carlos earns 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 from selling lemons. After deducting the cost of watering and feeding, he earns $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year. To start earning money, he needs to cover the initial cost of $90. So, it will take $90 / $7.5 = 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.
A[2]: Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. She sold 1/3 at the green house, which is x/3. Then she sold 2 more at the red house, which is x/3 + 2. Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. This equals 5. Solving the equation x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 gives x = 24. So, Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.
A[3]: 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students. So, 20 - 4 = 16 students remained. 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. Therefore, the remaining students, which is 16 - 4 = 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12 / 20 * 100% = 60%.
A[4]: If the jewelry market goes up by 2.5%, the value of the jewelry will be $5,000 + 0.025 * $5,000 = $5,125. If the electronic gadgets market goes up by 1.2%, the value of the gadgets will be $8,000 + 0.012 * $8,000 = $8,096. The profit from the jewelry would be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets would be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96. Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the jewelry, which would give him a profit of $125.

A[1]: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since they are on sale at 4 for $5.00, Terry spends 5 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt. Therefore, he spends 60 * 1.25 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
A[2]: John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * 15 = $195. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since he has $5 left, he must have spent $35 - $5 = $30 on lego sets. Therefore, he still has $30 / 15 = 2 lego sets left.
A[3]: John runs 60 miles a week, so he runs 60 / 3 = 20 miles each day he runs. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs 3 + 3/2 + 3/2 = 6 hours in total. Therefore, he runs at a speed of 20 miles / 6 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.
A[4]: If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 4 = 12 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking, then she runs for 6 / 3 = 2 hours and walks for 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours. Therefore, she travels 2 * 12 + 4 * 3 = 24 + 12 = 36 miles in six hours.

A[1]: Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, so for 20 candles he needs 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * $10 = $20. He sells each candle for $2, so for 20 candles he makes 20 * $2 = $40. His net profit is $40 - $20 = $20.
A[2]: On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, on Tuesday she wrote 5 * 2/5 = 2 more articles than on Monday, so on Tuesday she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. The total number of articles written in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours to write, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing articles in the three days.
A[3]: Candice started with 80 post-it notes, placed 220 at work, and had 23 remaining, so she must have purchased 80 + 220 + 23 = 323 post-it notes in total. Since she purchased a package of post-it notes, the number of post-it notes in the package is 323 - 80 = 243.
A[4]: John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 * 1.5 = $60 each. Therefore, he spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties. In total, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.
