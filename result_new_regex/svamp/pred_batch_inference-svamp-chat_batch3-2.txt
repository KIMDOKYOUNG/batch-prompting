A[3]: Julia played with 5 kids on Monday. If she played with a total of 15 kids and played with 5 kids on Monday, then she played with 15 - 5 = 10 kids on Tuesday. The answer is 10.
<d>
A[1]: Let x be the number of kids Julia played with on Monday. The total number of kids she played with is x + 14 = 16. Solving for x, x = 16 - 14 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 kids on Monday.
A[2]: Let y be the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday. Since she played with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday, we have y + 12 = 16. Solving for y, y = 16 - 12 = 4. Therefore, Julia played with 4 kids on Tuesday.
A[3]: Let z be the number of kids Julia played with on Monday. Since she played with 8 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday, we have z = 14 + 8 = 22. Therefore, Julia played with 22 kids on Monday.

A[1]: Julia played tag with 7 kids on Monday, 13 kids on Tuesday, and 20 kids on Wednesday. So, she played tag with a total of 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 kids altogether.
A[2]: Julia played tag with 12 kids on Monday and 14 kids on Tuesday, spending a total of 34 hours. Since each kid played for the same amount of time, the total number of kids she played with can be calculated by dividing the total time by the time spent per kid: 34 hours / (12 kids + 14 kids) = 34 hours / 26 kids = 1.307 hours per kid. Therefore, she played tag with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 kids altogether.
A[3]: Julia played tag with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday, spending a total of 38 hours. The difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday can be calculated by subtracting the number of kids on Tuesday from the number of kids on Monday: 19 kids - 18 kids = 1 more kid played with on Monday than on Tuesday.

A[1]: Let x be the number of pieces of candy Bobby ate at the start. He then ate 25 more, so the total number of pieces of candy he ate is x + 25. Since he ate a total of 43 pieces, we can write the equation x + 25 = 43. Solving for x, we get x = 43 - 25 = 18. Therefore, Bobby ate 18 pieces of candy at the start.
A[2]: Bobby ate 28 pieces of candy, then 42 more, and also 63 pieces of chocolate. The total number of pieces he ate is 28 + 42 + 63 = 133. Therefore, Bobby ate 133 pieces of candy and chocolate altogether.
A[3]: Bobby ate 33 pieces of candy, then 4 more, and also 14 pieces of chocolate. The total number of pieces he ate is 33 + 4 + 14 = 51. Therefore, Bobby ate 51 pieces of candy and chocolate altogether.
<d>
A[1]: Bobby ate 38 + 36 = 74 pieces of candy. He also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. So he ate 74 - 16 = 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate. The answer is 58.
A[2]: Bobby started with 20 pieces of candy. He ate 34 + 18 = 52 pieces of candy. The answer is 52.
A[3]: Bobby started with 21 pieces of candy. He ate 5 + 9 = 14 pieces of candy. So he has 21 - 14 = 7 pieces of candy left. The answer is 7.
<d>
A[1]: Bobby started with 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces and then ate 5 more. If he has 8 pieces left, he must have eaten 22 - 8 = 14 pieces of candy. The answer is 14.
A[2]: Bobby started with 19 pieces of candy. He ate 2 pieces. So he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy left. The answer is 17.
A[3]: Bobby started with 32 pieces of candy. If he has 20 pieces left, he must have eaten 32 - 20 = 12 pieces of candy. The answer is 12.

A[3]: If Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons, and Allan bought 3 more balloons, then Allan had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons, and Jake had 4 balloons. Allan had 5 - 4 = 1 more balloon than Jake in the park.
<d>
A[1]: Allan brought 2 + 3 = 5 balloons to the park. Jake brought 6 balloons. So, Jake had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.
A[2]: Allan brought 5 + 3 = 8 balloons to the park.
A[3]: Allan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 2 + 3 = 5 balloons to the park. Allan had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Jake in the park.
<d>
A[1]: Allan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons, so initially Jake had 3 - 6 = -3 fewer balloons than Allan. After Jake bought 4 more balloons, he had 3 + 4 = 7 balloons. So, Jake had 7 - 6 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.
A[2]: Jake initially brought 6 balloons and bought 3 more at the park, so he had 6 + 3 = 9 balloons in the park.
A[3]: Allan brought 3 balloons and Jake brought 5 balloons to the park, so they had 3 + 5 = 8 balloons in total.
<d>
A[1]: Allan brought 5 balls and Jake brought 4 balls, so in total they had 5 + 4 = 9 balls. The answer is 9.
A[2]: If Allan brought 5 balloons and they brought a total of 6 balloons, then Jake brought 6 - 5 = 1 balloon. The answer is 1.
A[3]: Allan had 2 balloons and bought 3 more, so he had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Jake brought 6 balloons, so he had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan. The answer is 1.
