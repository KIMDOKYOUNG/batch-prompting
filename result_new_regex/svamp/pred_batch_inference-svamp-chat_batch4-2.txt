A[1]: In each basket, there are 2 green peaches. Since there are 7 baskets, the total number of green peaches is 2 * 7 = 14. The answer is 14.
A[2]: In each basket, there are 3 green peaches. If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, then there are 7 / 3 = 2.33 baskets. Since we can't have a fraction of a basket, there are 2 baskets. The answer is 2.
A[3]: In each basket, there are 4 red peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in 2 baskets, then there are 12 / 2 = 6 peaches in each basket. Since 4 are red, there are 6 - 4 = 2 green peaches in each basket. The answer is 2.

A[4]: Jerry initially had 4 action figures. He added 8 - 4 = 4 more action figures to the shelf. The answer is 4.
<d>
A[1]: Let x be the number of action figures Jerry initially had on the shelf. After adding 7 more, the total number of action figures is x + 7. We know that the total number of action figures now is 10. Therefore, x + 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 10 - 7 = 3. So, Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.
A[2]: Initially, Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on the shelf. After adding 6 more action figures, the total number of action figures is 4 + 6 = 10. So, in total, there are 10 action figures on the shelf.
A[3]: Initially, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on the shelf. After adding 7 more action figures, the total number of action figures is 5 + 7 = 12. The number of books remains 9. Therefore, there are 12 - 9 = 3 more action figures than books on the shelf.
A[4]: Initially, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on the shelf. After adding 4 more action figures, the total number of action figures is 2 + 4 = 6. The number of books remains 10. Therefore, there are 10 - 6 = 4 more books than action figures on the shelf.
