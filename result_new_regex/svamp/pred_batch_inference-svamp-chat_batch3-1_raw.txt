A[1]: Julia played with 18 kids on Monday and 10 kids on Tuesday. The difference is 18 - 10 = 8. The answer is 8.
A[2]: Julia played with 11 kids on Monday and 12 kids on Tuesday. The difference is 12 - 11 = 1. The answer is 1.
A[3]: Julia played with 5 kids on Monday. If she played with a total of 15 kids, then she played with 15 - 5 = 10 kids on Tuesday. The answer is 10.
<d>
A[1]: Let x be the number of kids Julia played with on Monday. The total number of kids she played with is x + 14. Given that the total number of kids she played with is 16, we can write the equation x + 14 = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 16 - 14 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 kids on Monday.
A[2]: Let y be the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday. Given that she played with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday, we have the equation y + 12 = 16. Solving for y, we get y = 16 - 12 = 4. Therefore, Julia played with 4 kids on Tuesday.
A[3]: Given that Julia played with 8 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday, we can see that the number of kids she played with on Monday is y + 8. Since she played with 14 kids on Tuesday, we substitute y = 14 into the equation to get y + 8 = 14 + 8 = 22. Therefore, Julia played with 22 kids on Monday.

A[1]: Julia played tag with 7 kids on monday, 13 kids on tuesday, and 20 kids on wednesday. So, she played tag with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 kids altogether.
A[2]: Julia played tag with 12 kids on monday and 14 kids on tuesday, spending a total of 34 hours. Since each kid played for the same amount of time, the total number of kids she played with is 34 / (12 + 14) = 34 / 26 = 1.3 (approx). Since we can't have a fraction of a kid, it seems there might be a mistake in the question or the data provided.
