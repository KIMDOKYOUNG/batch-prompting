First, we find the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students. Then, we find the number of students remaining: 20 students - 4 students = 16 students. Next, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. Finally, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students. The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance out of the entire class: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%. Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The answer is 60.

A: The 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 water, so it contains 10 * 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water. The 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so it contains 15 * 3/5 = 9 liters of water. After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, there are 10 - 1 = 9 liters remaining. When combined with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, there are 9 + 15 = 24 liters total. The remaining water content in the 24 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. The answer is 15.67.

Marie ordered 5 packs of milk at $3 each, which is 5 * 3 = $15. She also ordered 4 apples at $1.50 each, which is 4 * 1.50 = $6. The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is 12 + 15 + 6 = $33. If the total amount paid was $50, then the cost of the pizza is 50 - 33 = $17. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered 17 / 8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza. Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

John runs 60 miles in a week, so he runs 60 / 3 = 20 miles per day on average. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours on the other two days. To find his speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 20 miles / (3 + 1.5 + 1.5) hours = 20 / 6 = 3.33 miles per hour. Therefore, John runs at a speed of 3.33 miles per hour.  The answer is 3.33.

Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. She spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking, which means she runs for 6 / 3 = 2 hours and walks for 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours. In 2 hours, she can travel 6 * 2 = 12 miles while running, and in 4 hours, she can travel 4 * 6 = 24 miles while walking. In total, she can travel 12 + 24 = 36 miles in six hours.

Let x be the number of copies Harald sold.   Marilyn sold 10x copies.   The total number of copies sold is x + 10x = 11x.   Given that 11x = 88,000, we can solve for x:   x = 88,000 / 11 = 8000.

A: If 1/4 of the guests don't show up, then 16 * 1/4 = 4 guests won't attend. So she will need 16 - 4 = 12 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 12 * 2 = $24. The answer is 24.

A: The adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 lbs of potato salad in total. The children will eat 5 * 10 / 2 = 25 lbs of potato salad in total. So Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad to feed everyone.  The answer is 225.

A: Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. In total, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets. The answer is 28.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, and 2 years younger than Corey. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.  The answer is 4.

Let's first calculate how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles: Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which means rabbits = dogs + cats - 12. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. Therefore, rabbits = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348. The answer is 348.

Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, which is 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. So, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, which means 120 * 2/3 = 80 girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40. The answer is 40.

A: James slept 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3.

Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, which means she started with 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes. Each 16 ounce can contains 3 tomatoes, so Freda used 64 / 16 * 3 = 12 tomatoes. Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make the sauce. The answer is 12.

A: Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars remained. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5. The answer is 5.

Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, totaling 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. After receiving 18 new potted plants, Mary has a total of 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants. If she gives away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges, she will be left with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants. Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.  The answer is 58.
