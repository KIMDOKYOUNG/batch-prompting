To calculate the profit, we first need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. The increase in value is 150% of the original value, which is 150% * $80,000 = $120,000.   So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.   Josh's total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.   Therefore, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Carla downloads at 2 GB/minute, so it would normally take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the file. However, she is interrupted 40% of the way through, which is 200 * 0.4 = 80 GB. This means she has 200 - 80 = 120 GB left to download. The interruption takes 20 minutes, so she has to restart the download and it will take her an additional 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to finish. In total, it will take her 20 + 60 = 80 minutes to download the file. The answer is 80.

Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. She sold x/3 at the green house. Then she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with x - x/3 - 2. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. This equals 5. So, x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5. Solving this equation gives x = 30. Therefore, Melanie started with 30 vacuum cleaners.

First, we find the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students. Next, we find the number of students remaining after contemporary dance enrollment: 20 - 4 = 16 students. Then, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. Finally, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 16 - 4 = 12 students. To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: (12 / 20) * 100% = 60%. Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The answer is 60.

A: The 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 water, so it contains 10 * 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water. The 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so it contains 15 * 3/5 = 9 liters of water. After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, there are 10 - 1 = 9 liters remaining. When combined with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, there are 9 + 15 = 24 liters total. The remaining 24 liters contain 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water. The answer is 15.67.

John runs 60 miles in a week, so he runs 60 / 3 = 20 miles per day on average. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours on the other two days. To find his speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 20 miles / (3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours) = 20 / 6 = 3.33 miles per hour. Therefore, John runs at a speed of 3.33 miles per hour.
<d>
Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. So, she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking, she runs for 6 / 3 = 2 hours and walks for 4 hours. In 2 hours, she can travel 6 * 2 = 12 miles. In 4 hours, she can travel 4 * 3 = 12 miles. Therefore, in total, she can travel 12 + 12 = 24 miles in six hours.

A: The bag has 5 servings, so it contains 5 * 250 = 1250 calories in total. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left. To find out how many grams you can eat, you need to calculate the calories per gram. Since the bag has 300g and 1250 calories, each gram contains 1250 / 300 = 4.166... calories. Therefore, you can eat 200 / 4.166... = 48 grams. The answer is 48.

Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup per day for the first 180 days, which is a total of 1 * 180 = 180 cups. For the rest of the year, she will feed the puppy 2 cups per day, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, for the rest of the year, she will need 2 * 185 = 370 cups. In total, she will need 180 + 370 = 550 cups in the first year. Since one bag contains 110 cups, she will need 550 / 110 = 5 bags of dog food in the first year. Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

A: If 1/4 of the guests don't show up, then 16 * 1/4 = 4 guests won't attend. So she will need 16 - 4 = 12 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 12 * 2 = $24. The answer is 24.

Ted needs to bring enough potato salad to feed 20 adults and 5 children. Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so 1 child is equivalent to 0.5 adults. Therefore, the total number of "adult equivalents" is 20 + 5 * 0.5 = 22.5. Since each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, Ted needs to bring 22.5 * 10 = 225 lbs of potato salad to feed everyone. The answer is 225.

A: Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. Together, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets. The answer is 28.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, and Corey is 2 years older than Amy. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old. The answer is 4.

Let's first calculate how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles:   Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

The number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. The combined number of dogs and cats is 120 + 60 = 180. The number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 168 + 120 + 60 = 348.

Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, which is 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys. So, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, which is 120 * 2/3 = 80 girls. Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40. The answer is 40.

A: James slept 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3.

Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, which means she started with 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes. Each 16 ounce can contains 3 tomatoes, so Freda used 64 / 16 * 3 = 12 tomatoes. Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make the sauce. The answer is 12.

A: Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars remained. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5. The answer is 5.

Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, totaling 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. After receiving 18 new potted plants, Mary will have 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants. If she gives away 1 potted plant from each ledge, she will give away 40 * 1 = 40 potted plants. Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants. Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants. The answer is 58.
