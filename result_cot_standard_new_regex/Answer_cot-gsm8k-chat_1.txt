Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it would normally take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the file. However, she was 40% through the download when the restart occurred, so she had already downloaded 200 * 0.4 = 80 GB. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 200 - 80 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes. Adding the 20 minutes for the restart, the total time it takes to download the file is 60 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, covering a distance of 3 * 60 = 180 miles. Then he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't move. After that, he drove for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles. Finally, he drove for 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering a distance of 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles. In total, he is 180 - 15 + 120 = 285 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours. The answer is 285.

A: The 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 water, so it contains 10 * 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water. The 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so it contains 15 * 3/5 = 9 liters of water. After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, there are 10 - 1 = 9 liters remaining. When combined with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, there are 9 + 15 = 24 liters total. The total water content in the remaining 24 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. The answer is 15.67.

Marie ordered 5 packs of milk at $3 each, which is 5 * 3 = $15. She also ordered 4 apples at $1.50 each, which is 4 * 1.50 = $6. The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is 12 + 15 + 6 = $33. If the total amount paid was $50, then the cost of the pizza is 50 - 33 = $17. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered 17 / 8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza. Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

A: The bag has 5 servings, so it contains 5 * 250 = 1250 calories in total. If you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left. To find out how many grams you can eat, you need to calculate the calories per gram. Since the bag has 300g and 1250 calories, each gram contains 1250 / 300 = 4.166... calories. Therefore, you can eat 200 / 4.166... = 48 grams of chips. The answer is 48.

Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup per day for the first 180 days, which is a total of 180 cups. Then she will feed the puppy 2 cups per day for the remaining days in the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. This totals to 185 * 2 = 370 cups. In total, she will need 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in the first year. Since one bag contains 110 cups, she will need 550 / 110 = 5 bags of dog food. Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

A: The adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 lbs of potato salad in total. The children will eat 5 * 10 / 2 = 25 lbs of potato salad in total. So Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad to feed everyone.  The answer is 225.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, and 2 years younger than Corey. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is 4.

Let's first calculate how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles: Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds slower than Lee, so Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which means rabbits = dogs + cats - 12. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. Therefore, rabbits = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348. The answer is 348.

There are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys in Grade 5. So, there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls in Grade 5. Out of the girls, 2/3 are in the girl scout, which means 120 * 2/3 = 80 girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, 120 - 80 = 40 girls are not in the girl scout.  The answer is 40.

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours. Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James. The answer is 3.

Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, which means she started with 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes. Since each 16 ounce can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 64 / 16 * 3 = 12 tomatoes. Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make the sauce. The answer is 12.

A: Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. 5 cars took an exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars remained. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5. The answer is 5.

Mary has 40 window ledges with 2 potted plants each, totaling 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants. After receiving 18 new potted plants, Mary has a total of 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants. If she gives away 1 potted plant from each ledge, she will give away 40 * 1 = 40 potted plants. Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants. Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants. The answer is 58.
