A: Julia played with 19 + 18 = 37 kids in total. She spent 38 hours playing tag. To find the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday, we can set up the equation: 19x + 18y = 38, where x is the number of hours she played with 19 kids and y is the number of hours she played with 18 kids. Since she played with 19 kids on Monday, x = 1. Therefore, 19(1) + 18y = 38, which simplifies to 19 + 18y = 38. Solving for y, we get y = 1. So, she played with 1 more kid on Monday than on Tuesday.

<d>
Let's denote the number of red peaches as R. We know that there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches, so the number of green peaches is R + 10. Given that there are 3 red peaches in the basket, we can set up the equation R + R + 10 = 3. Solving this equation, we get R = 1, which means there is 1 red peach in the basket. Therefore, the number of green peaches is R + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11.

<d>
Let's denote the number of baskets as x. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, totaling 4 + 3 = 7 peaches per basket. Since there are x baskets in total, the total number of peaches is 7x. Given that there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, we can set up the equation 7x = 7. Solving for x, we get x = 1. Therefore, there is 1 basket of peaches.
<d>
